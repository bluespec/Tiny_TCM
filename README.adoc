A _tiny_ TCM for non-pipelined use. This near-mem implements a
resource-constrained TCM implementation minimizing gate/LUT count with little
concession for performance.

This near-mem is intended for use in small cores where low resource
utilization trumps performance.

The starter code for this version is from the following commit of the magritte
repository:
